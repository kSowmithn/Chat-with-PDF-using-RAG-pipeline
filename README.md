# Chat-with-PDF-using-RAG-pipeline

In today’s fast-paced world, managing and accessing information from large documents such as PDFs can be cumbersome. Whether it's academic research, legal documents, or business reports, finding relevant information within long texts often requires significant time and effort. The Chat with PDF using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline solves this problem by allowing users to ask specific questions about a PDF and receive accurate, contextually relevant answers in natural language. This system leverages a combination of two powerful techniques: retrieval-based methods and generative models.

At its core, the RAG pipeline uses retrieval to search for the most relevant content in a document based on a user’s query and generation to craft a fluent, human-like response using that retrieved content. The process starts with text extraction from the PDF using PyMuPDF, a reliable tool for reading and extracting text from PDFs. The extracted text is then divided into smaller, manageable chunks to ensure more efficient processing and avoid overwhelming the system with large amounts of data.

Next, embeddings for both the text chunks and the user query are generated using models like SentenceTransformers, which transform the text into a numerical format that captures the meaning of the content. The most relevant chunk is selected using cosine similarity to compare the query embedding against the embeddings of the chunks. Finally, the selected chunk is passed through a question-answering model such as distilbert or a text generation model like GPT-2 to produce a coherent and context-aware response.

This approach provides significant advantages, including speed, accuracy, and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from research to business and legal domains. With this system, users can interact naturally with PDFs, extracting meaningful insights and improving their productivity.
